# FMKC Wiki

This is the Wiki-site for FMKC community

## Installation

Setup Hugo to work locally [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). CD into root folder and run

```bash
hugo server
```

## Editing content

You can edit the "page" files in the "content" folder. The files are in .MD format so they are easily editable. You can also use Forestry CMS to edit the content but this requires a login that you need to ask the adminitrators of fmkc-wiki.

## Props

Anyone who helps out editing the content can be added in the bottom of said page to its props section, look on other pages for examples of this. Helping out gets your username out there ;)
